        - **Early Warning System:** The developed model can serve as a basis for an early warning system for air quality in the relevant area.
        - **Policy Insights:** Feature analysis provides policymakers with insights into which pollutants are most influential and should be prioritized.
        - **Academic Contribution:** The comprehensive preprocessing methodology quantitatively demonstrates that feature selection and outlier removal can significantly improve model accuracy.

        - **Single-City Data:** The model was trained exclusively on data from Beijing, limiting its generalizability to other cities.
        - **Unforeseen Events:** The ARIMAX model may struggle to predict extreme pollution spikes caused by unexpected events (e.g., large wildfires).
        - **Linearity Assumption:** The underlying ARIMA model assumes linear relationships, whereas real-world pollution dynamics can be highly non-linear.

    1.  **Advanced Models:** Implement deep learning models like **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)** or **Transformers** to better capture non-linear patterns.
    2.  **Additional Data Sources:** Integrate data from satellite imagery (Aerosol Optical Depth), traffic data, or industrial activity to enrich the exogenous features.
    3.  **Real-time Deployment:** Develop the system into a real-time application that automatically fetches the latest data and provides hourly forecasts.
    4.  **Multi-City Analysis:** Expand the analysis to compare and model air quality across multiple cities to discover more generalizable patterns.
